 ## <img src="assets/info-circle-solid.svg" width="30px"> About me 


 - Greetings! I'm Jizhen Cai, a dedicated Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science, poised to defend my thesis in March 2024. My academic journey reflects a passion for big data, machine learning, deep learning, and a keen interest in data processing and software development.

- I specialize in MATLAB and Python, and my research contributions include extending unmixing methods to multispectral images and introducing an attention-based triple-stream fused CNN model for hyperspectral image classification. Proficient in English and French, I bring technical versatility and innovative thinking to every project.

- I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills to Docteur R&D Data Scientist/Analyse de données, combining my academic achievements with a practical approach to solving real-world challenges.

- **Extending the Unmixing methods to Multispectral Images**

  *Key words: Unmixing, Remote Sensing, Multispectral Images, Hyperspectral Images*

  In this paper, we have created two simulated multispectral datasets from two hyperspectral datasets whose ground truths are given. Then we apply the unmixing methods (VCA, NMF, N-FINDR) to these two datasets. The results demonstrate the possibilities in extending these unmixing methods to the field of multispectral imaging.

- **Comparison of Linear Unmixing Methods on Paintings Data Set**

  *Key words: Hyperspectral Unmixing, Endmember Extraction*

  Hyperspectral unmixing consists in extracting Endmembers and estimating the abundance of each Endmember in each pixel of the images. In this article, we present three state of the art methods in Endmembers Extraction. These methods are originally used in the field of remote sensing. They are applied to a new domain: paintings. We compare and analyze their performances and results.

- **ATSFCNN: A Novel Attention-based Triple-Stream Fused CNN Model for Hyperspectral Image Classification**

  *Key words: Deep Learning, CNN, Attention Mechanism, Hyperspectral Classification*

  In this paper, we propose a novel CNN model named ATSFCNN (Attention-based Triple-Stream Fused Convolutional Neural Network) that fuses the features of 1D-CNN, 2D-CNN, and 3D-CNN to consider all the relevant information of the hyperspectral dataset. Our contributions are twofold: First, we propose a strategy to extract and homogenize features from 1D, 2D, and 3D CNN. Secondly, we propose a way to efficiently fuse these features.
