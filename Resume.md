- **Extending the Unmixing methods to Multispectral Images**

  *Key words: Unmixing, Remote Sensing, Multispectral Images, Hyperspectral Images*

  In this paper, we have created two simulated multispectral datasets from two hyperspectral datasets whose ground truths are given. Then we apply the unmixing methods (VCA, NMF, N-FINDR) to these two datasets. The results demonstrate the possibilities in extending these unmixing methods to the field of multispectral imaging.

- **ATSFCNN: A Novel Attention-based Triple-Stream Fused CNN Model for Hyperspectral Image Classification**

  *Key words: Deep Learning, CNN, Attention Mechanism, Hyperspectral Classification*

  In this paper, we propose a novel CNN model named ATSFCNN (Attention-based Triple-Stream Fused Convolutional Neural Network) that fuses the features of 1D-CNN, 2D-CNN, and 3D-CNN to consider all the relevant information of the hyperspectral dataset. Our contributions are twofold: First, we propose a strategy to extract and homogenize features from 1D, 2D, and 3D CNN. Secondly, we propose a way to efficiently fuse these features.
